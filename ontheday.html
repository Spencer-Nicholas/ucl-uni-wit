          <br> We hope you enjoyed our 2018 Women in Technology InterConnect+ event last week at the University of Manchester!
          This takeaway email is our recap of the day where the “Press for Progress” theme touched upon three perspectives
          - progress in diversity, in technology and in our careers.
          <br>
          <br> After our host, Sharon Moore, opened the event we got straight into the diversity theme, with Allyson Zimmermann
          from Catalyst who got us thinking about microinequalities, microaggressions and microaffirmations. The equation
          she asked us to remember is ‘Inclusion = Belonging + Uniqueness’: we need to be celebrated for the individuals
          we are, but also feel that we belong to a group.
          <br>
          <br> Drs Maria Pampaka and Diane Harris, from the University of Manchester shared their key lesson about the influence
          of parents on their children choosing to pursue careers in engineering and STEM industry. Jon Tilt shared his expertise
          as a Master Athlete and coach, in overcoming life hurdles. Jon taught us that the only bad race is one the runner
          does not learn from - and so we all want to give a humongous thanks to Jon for his courage to be with us.
          <br>
          <br> After lunch we began to explore diversity theme with Prof. Uli Sattler covering the work she has been doing to
          ensure female students feel that they belong. Then our minds were blown by the amount of data that will be generated
          as part of the SKA project that Prof. Anna Scaife shared with us. We reflected that future progress in technology
          here is also helping us explore our past.
          <br>
          <br> Our final section of the day featured a number of IBMer role models who also explored the future of technology
          in lightning talks, then formed a panel to think about progress in careers again. We began to realise that some
          of the education we can get through IBM is an essential that other organisations do not offer. We were left with
          “half an idea is better than no idea”, which concludes on Pressing for Progress in our everyday lives.
          <br>
          <br> Our team would also like to thank the men that came along; the ratios for this event were the reverse of what
          we who identify as women usually experience! We do deliberately want to bring women together so they are with more
          people who are likely to be like them, but it’s so important to include everybody in the conversation - this is
          not just a ‘women’s problem’, and to have allies in the room is great thing.
          <br>
          <br> A second WIT Interconnect will be run in 2018, and the best way to ensure your place is to be on the team or speak
          on the day! Do get in touch with us on Slack if you want to join in. There’s a ‘next year’ channel especially for
          this sort of discussion:

          <br>
          <br> Of course, if you don’t have access to this please just drop sharon.moore@uk.ibm.com a note.
          <br>
          <br> Thank you one more time!
